### Update
This week was just more assembly and bug fixing.  We have completed building a USB module and our other PCBs and parts are continuing to come in.  We did some additional work on the report and are also developing a small Python application to emulate a connected device like a light switch or some other electronic.  This will reduce our budget so we don't need to order another Bluetooth outlet.

In the next week, we will finish up our final case designs for the three components and our written report, while continuing to build the hardware and polish and refine our desktop application in parallel.
