### Integration Testing
Last week, we built the wearable and performed integration testing of the desktop Python application and hardware.  We were able to successfully get our product to work by turning on/off speakers based on the proximity of the wearable to the zone module.  We also worked on smoothing out the signal, fixing some bugs in the desktop application and polishing up the GUI.  However, at this point we have a product that works and we are happy with the form factor.

### Improvements
We also improved the PCB for the wearable as well as designed and ordered PCBs for the zone module and USB dongle.  Once we have all three PCBs and parts for them, we will be able to build the final version of our product.  We added a charging circuit and on/off switch for our wearable need to modify our case to expose the charging port to the outside.

### Other Deliverables
We also started working on the final report and will complete that in parallel with the bug-fixing, improvements and assembly of the final hardware.
