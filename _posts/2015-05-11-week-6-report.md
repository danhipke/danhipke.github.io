### Hardware

Last week, we finally received all of the hardware we need to build 3 wearables.  We also finalized our Arduino code for our wearable, zone module and USB dongle. This week, we will start building the prototype on our PCB and adjust our enclosure design to fit it.  After testing our batteries, it appears as though all our components will work together and our wearable will have more than enough battery life for our purposes.

### Desktop Application

Last week, we also finalized our frontend application design and began integrating our code.  We have two-way serial communication between our USB dongle and python application, so now we just need to incorporate that into our GUI.  We met on Sunday to finalize the integration of the GUI and serial communication code and plan to have that finished by the end of this week.  Once our hardware prototypes on the PCB are built, we should be able to test the system as a whole.

### Other Deliverables

We also plan to start on the final report this week just so that everyone has something to work on.  Once an initial draft is completed, we will review as a team.
