This week was pretty slow as we were waiting for parts to come in to start testing our ideas and creating a POC with the RF modules.  In lab on Tuesday, we met to finalize our project proposal as well as create a project schedule.  You can see our final project proposal, BOM and project schedule <a href="http://danhipke.github.io/">here</a>

We ordered 2 of the RFM12B Radio Transceivers for building a POC using Arduinos we already own.  We wanted to make sure that the modules will fit our needs before ordering all 8.  We plan to implement basic communication between the modules while testing the signal strength and range capabilities as well. Additionally, we ordered the Plugable Bluetooth-Controlled AC Power Switch which we will control using open-source Python APIs.  The power switch will communicate with the desktop application in our demo to turn a light on and off based on proximity.

All parts mentioned above arrived over the last few days and we plan to work on a POC in lab on Tuesday.
