### Final Updates

We finished the hardware and software components of our project this week.  We have created the final wearable, zone module and USB module all with 3D-printed cases.  We have also finished up the final tweaks to the desktop application, although we are still doing some minor tweaks to the proximity calculation to make our demo run as smoothly as possible.  Today, we will be testing our demo in the Atrium to prepare for the demos on Wednesday. 

We have also finished the poster and are just about done with the report (we still need to add pictures/figures).  We will be printing the poster on Tuesday in preparation for Wednesday.

Other than that we are all ready to go for Wednesday.
